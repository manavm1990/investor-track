# Capstone Server

Update `package.json` with name of our capstone followed by: `-server` (and author name).

1. `npm run webpack` - starts `webpack`, which transpiles your code into `dist/main.js`
2. `npm start` - starts `nodemon`, which watches ðŸ‘€ your `dist/main.js` for updates.

Don't 4 get to ~~drink your Ovaltine~~ add your `.env` (MongoDB, `PORT`, etc.)
